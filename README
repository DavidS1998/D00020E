To run each of the systems, do the following:
Build the files with all its dependencies
  go build thermometer/thermometer.go
  go build valve/valve.go
  go build thermostat/thermostat.go
Then run it in the shell with the generated files
  ./thermometer
  ./valve
  ./thermostat
  
For the valve system to interface with the hardware servo properly, download and install pi-blaster and run it with the following paramters:
  sudo pi-blaster --gpio 11 --pcm

See instructions on the associated GitHub pages on how to run the Service Registry and Orchestrator systems.
