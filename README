Port: 8091 display a "Get" link and a "send Request", its a page for manually registering service.

Port: 8092 display the current position of the servo in borth percentage form and decimal form. The servo position can be between 0-180. If the current postion of the servo is 90 it means that the current postion of the servo is 50%.
